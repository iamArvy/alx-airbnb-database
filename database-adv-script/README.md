# ðŸ“‚ database-adv-script

This folder contains a collection of advanced SQL scripts and performance optimization reports for the **ALX Airbnb database** project. The scripts in this directory are designed to demonstrate the practical use of SQL in analyzing, optimizing, and scaling relational databases through real-world examples.

The focus is on writing complex queries, implementing indexing, optimizing large datasets, and continuously improving query performance through execution plan analysis and schema design.

## ðŸ§  What You'll Find in This Folder

This folder includes:

- **Advanced SQL queries** using joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
- **Window functions** for ranking and advanced analytics.
- **Indexing strategies** to optimize common query paths.
- **Performance analysis** using `EXPLAIN`, `SHOW PROFILE`, and partitioning.
- **Refactored queries** and schema changes based on query plans.
- **Reports** documenting observed performance improvements.
